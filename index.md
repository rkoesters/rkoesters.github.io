Welcome
=======

Welcome to my personal web page. This site was programmed with HTML5 in mind,
and, as it is a personal website, I put very little effort into ensuring
compatibility with older browsers. If you don't already, I suggest using
[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) or
[Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome) (or
[Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home)).
