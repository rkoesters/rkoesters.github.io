Here is a subset of the programming projects that I have worked on in my free
time.

## Trumpet (Twitter bot)

Trumpet is a Twitter bot that generates tweets based on the accounts it
follows. It is designed to support several methods for generating and
scheduling tweets. The default generator uses Markov chains to produce tweets.
The default scheduler schedules tweets to go out whenever the accounts it
follows tweets.

## xkcd (go package)

Package xkcd is used by Comic Sticks to access the xkcd API. The main benefit
of using this package instead of the API directly is to properly handle the
text encoding (the JSON package in Go's standard library expects UTF-8, however
xkcd's API delivers ISO8859-1 encoded text).
